# Personal Home Page

Welcome to my Persona Home page. This `develop` branch contains the sources for bulding it, you can find the build version under `master` branch.

This site has been build using create-react-app using typescript template.

CSS is applied via Styled Components.

Code style assured with Prettier and ESLint.

As there is only one route, no need for react router yet.

As there is no global app object, no need for redux.

Just trying to keep this page simple and readable.
